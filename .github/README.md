# configuration files

Standard configuration files from my development machine.  The root of this
repository reflects the root of my home folder.  I manage them in a git bare
repo detailed in this [Atlassian Developer
post](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

## installation
```bash
# omit pipe to bash to inspect file first
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvacaliuc/dotfiles/master/.config/bootstrap.sh | bash
```
